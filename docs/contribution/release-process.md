# Yoko Release Guide

This document describes the standardized release process for Yoko.

## 🎯 Overview

Yoko uses a **branch-based release workflow** with Gradle automation. Releases are prepared in dedicated `release/X.Y.Z` branches on origin, tagged, and then fast-forward merged to main after verification. The process ensures:

- ✅ Consistent version management
- ✅ Isolated release preparation in dedicated branches
- ✅ Automated validation before release
- ✅ Complete release artifacts (JARs, sources, javadoc, checksums)
- ✅ Automated CHANGELOG generation
- ✅ GitHub releases with all binaries
- ✅ Clean fast-forward merge to main after successful release

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting a release, ensure you have:

1. **Git** - For version control
   - **Important:** All release commands explicitly use `origin` remote
   - If your default push remote is a fork, the commands will still push to `origin`
2. **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** - For creating releases
   - Install: https://cli.github.com/
   - Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. **git-cliff** (optional) - For CHANGELOG generation
   - Install: https://git-cliff.org/docs/installation
4. **SDKMAN** (recommended) - For Java version management
   - Install: https://sdkman.io/

## 🚀 Standard Release Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

```bash
# Initialize SDKMAN environment (if using)
sdk env

# Ensure you're on main branch with latest changes
git switch main
git pull origin main

# Verify everything is clean
git status
```

### Step 2: Create Release Branch

Create a dedicated release branch for the new version:

```bash
# Create and push release branch to origin (replace X.Y.Z with your version)
git switch -c release/X.Y.Z
git push -u origin release/X.Y.Z
```

### Step 3: Bump the Version

Choose the appropriate version bump (major, minor, or patch):

```bash
# Interactive version bump (recommended)
gradle bumpVersion

# Or non-interactive (for automation)
gradle bumpVersionNonInteractive -PversionBump=patch
```

This will:
1. Detect the current version from git tags in your branch ancestry
2. Check for conflicting versions elsewhere in the repository
3. Display available version bump options (letter-based menu):
   - **[J]** maJor version bump
   - **[N]** miNor version bump
   - **[P]** Patch version bump
   - **[C]** Cancel
4. Validate the selected bump doesn't conflict with existing tags
5. Provide git commands to create and push the new version tag

**Note**: Options may be marked "UNAVAILABLE" if they would conflict with existing versions. You must merge/rebase to include higher versions before bumping.

**Create and push the version tag:**

```bash
# Create annotated tag (replace X.Y.Z with your version)
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"

# Push tag to origin
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

### Step 4: Update CHANGELOG

Generate release notes from git commits:

```bash
gradle updateChangelog
```

This uses `git-cliff` to extract commits since the last release and updates `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Review and commit the CHANGELOG:**

```bash
# Review the changes
git diff CHANGELOG.md

# Stage only the relevant changes
git add -p CHANGELOG.md

# Commit
git commit -m "chore: update CHANGELOG for vX.Y.Z"
git push origin release/X.Y.Z  # Always push to origin for releases
```

### Step 5: Validate Release Readiness

Run comprehensive validation checks:

```bash
gradle validateRelease
```

This checks:
- ✓ Version format (semantic versioning)
- ✓ CHANGELOG contains current version
- ✓ Git working directory is clean
- ✓ No existing tag for this version
- ✓ No existing GitHub release
- ✓ GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated
- ✓ Tests have been run

**Fix any issues** before proceeding.

### Step 6: Create the Release

Execute the complete release process:

```bash
gradle release
```

This will:
1. Verify all prerequisites
2. Build all release artifacts (6 modules × 3 JARs each)
3. Generate SHA-256 and SHA-512 checksums
4. Extract release notes from CHANGELOG
5. Create distribution archive
6. Create Git tag `vX.Y.Z`
7. Create GitHub release with all artifacts

### Step 7: Verify the Release

1. **Check GitHub Release:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/OpenLiberty/yoko/releases
   - Verify all artifacts are present
   - Verify release notes are correct

2. **Test Artifacts:**
   ```bash
   # Download a JAR and verify checksum
   wget https://github.com/OpenLiberty/yoko/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/yoko-core-X.Y.Z.jar
   wget https://github.com/OpenLiberty/yoko/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/yoko-core-X.Y.Z.jar.sha256
   sha256sum -c yoko-core-X.Y.Z.jar.sha256
   ```

3. **Verify Git Tag:**
   ```bash
   git fetch --tags
   git tag -l vX.Y.Z
   git show vX.Y.Z
   ```

### Step 8: Merge to Main

Once the release is verified and tagged, merge the release branch to main using a fast-forward merge:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git switch main
git pull origin main

# Fast-forward merge the release branch
git merge --ff-only release/X.Y.Z

# Push to origin (explicitly specify origin for releases)
git push origin main

# Optionally, delete the release branch
git branch -d release/X.Y.Z
git push origin --delete release/X.Y.Z
```

**Note:** The `--ff-only` flag ensures a clean fast-forward merge. If this fails, it means main has diverged from the release branch, and you should investigate before proceeding.

## 📦 Release Artifacts

Each release includes:

### Per Module (6 modules)
- `{module}-{version}.jar` - Main library
- `{module}-{version}-sources.jar` - Source code
- `{module}-{version}-javadoc.jar` - API documentation

## 🔄 Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

Yoko follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Development Versions

During development, builds automatically append metadata:
- Format: `{version}.{YYYYMMDD}_{gitHash}`
- Example: `1.6.1.20260416_a1b2c3d`

### Release Versions

Release versions use the exact version from `gradle.properties`:
- Format: `X.Y.Z`
- Example: `1.6.1`

## 🔐 Security

### Checksums

All artifacts include:
- **SHA-256**: Fast, widely supported
- **SHA-512**: More secure, recommended for verification

### Verification

```bash
# Verify SHA-256
sha256sum -c artifact.jar.sha256

# Verify SHA-512
sha512sum -c artifact.jar.sha512
```

### GitHub Signatures

All releases are signed by GitHub's release system.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Git working directory is not clean"

**Solution:** Commit or stash your changes:
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
# or
git stash
```

### "Git tag vX.Y.Z already exists"

**Solution:** Either use a different version or delete the tag:
```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
```

### "GitHub release vX.Y.Z already exists"

**Solution:** Delete the release first:
```bash
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes
```

### "Version X.Y.Z not found in CHANGELOG.md"

**Solution:** Update the CHANGELOG:
```bash
gradle updateChangelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: update CHANGELOG for vX.Y.Z"
```

### "GitHub CLI (gh) not found"

**Solution:** Install GitHub CLI:
- macOS: `brew install gh`
- Linux: https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md
- Windows: https://github.com/cli/cli/releases

### "GitHub authentication not configured"

**Solution:** Authenticate with GitHub:
```bash
gh auth login
```

## 🔄 Rolling Back a Release

If you need to roll back a release:

### 1. Delete GitHub Release

```bash
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes
```

### 2. Delete Git Tag

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
```

### 3. Revert Version Changes

```bash
# Revert the version bump commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or manually edit gradle.properties
# Then commit the change
git add gradle.properties
git commit -m "chore: revert version to previous"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Update CHANGELOG (if needed)

Remove or update the release entry in CHANGELOG.md.

## 📚 Best Practices

1. **Always run tests** before releasing:
   ```bash
   gradle test
   ```

2. **Use semantic versioning** consistently

3. **Keep CHANGELOG up to date** with meaningful entries

4. **Validate before releasing**:
   ```bash
   gradle validateRelease
   ```

5. **Test the release artifacts** after publishing

6. **Announce releases** to relevant channels

7. **Create releases from a dedicated release branch** (`release/X.Y.Z`)

8. **Use fast-forward merge** to integrate release branch to main

9. **Never force-push** to main after a release

10. **Delete release branches** after successful merge (optional but recommended)
